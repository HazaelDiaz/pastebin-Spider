I chose the topic of Super Mario 64 ROM hacks as my research topic. I chose this topic because I find SM64 a really fun game, and the ROM hacks of it allow people to experience fresh levels and concepts over and over again. Super Mario 64 is a game that came out in 1996 for the Nintendo 64 [https://www.gamefaqs.com/n64/198848-super-mario-64/data], and was one of the very first proper 3D games that was not first-person, so the camera is a separate identity from the player. In 2009, the first proper ROM hack of SM64 was released, titled “SM64: The Missing Stars” [https://sites.google.com/site/messiaen64/themissingstars]. This featured all new levels and a completely refreshing experience for everyone who had already played everything SM64 had to offer. This is the reason why I chose SM64 ROM hacks as my research project. My key questions were about how legal ROM hacks actually are, which hacks are the most popular and about the process of creating them.


The first question is a very common question about ROM hacks: how legal are they? Well, after some research I managed to conclude that it is possible to make and distribute ROM hacks, but you do have to be quite careful with how you do it. The article [https://www.zophar.net/articles/FairUseROMs.html] says a few things about the legality of ROMs. First of all, the issue arises about obtaining a copy of SM64. Isn’t this piracy? Well, if you already legally own a copy of SM64, then no. No law is stopping you from dumping the game onto your PC. Obviously, many people simply choose to download the file off the Internet instead, but if you already own a legal copy of the game then how you got the file does not matter. What about the people who don’t own a copy? Well, then downloading it off the internet technically is illegal and you could be fined for piracy. But remember, this is a 20-year old game we’re talking about here. Nintendo is not going to really pay much attention to people who download the game illegally. I am NOT saying it is good to illegally download the game, nor am I suggesting it as an option. I am merely pointing out that you are extremely unlikely to get in trouble for it.

The second issue the article deals with is modifying the ROM itself. The law (quoted in the same article) basically states that modification of a copyrighted work is legal IF you are doing it for non-commercial, non-profit purposes. However, making ROM hacks is about letting other people play them, and this falls under commercial use. This can be remedied by making a “patch” of your hack. The patch contains a set of instructions for converting the original ROM into your modified ROM. It is perfectly legal to share a patch online, as everything it contains was made by you and contains none of Nintendo’s content. People can then download your patch and apply it to their own ROMs. Some people choose not to do this and instead upload “pre-patched” ROM hacks. This is again technically illegal, but the worst that can happen is that your hack will get DMCA’d (Digital Millennium Copyright Act), which just disables the download. When this happens, the hack creator will usually upload a patch, or if they really don’t care, will just reupload the ROM.





Now that we’ve sorted out the legality of hacks, let’s move onto the second question, which was: What are the most popular ROM hacks? Well, if you Google “SM64 ROM hacks”, one of the first hacks you’re likely to see is one called SM64: Last Impact [https://gamingreinvented.com/reviews/super-mario-64-last-impact-genuinely-great-mod-classic-game/]. The hack was made by Kaze Emanuar, a dedicated SM64 hacker, and consists of over 4000 hours of work and many completely new features. A few other hacks you may find are Super Mario Odyssey 64, Super Mario 64 Maker and Super Mario 64 Online. These hacks are all made by Kaze as well, and in fact you’re likely going to have to search a while before you find an article on a hack that was not made by Kaze. Kaze is by far the most popular ROM hacker there ever was. So why is this? Well, he’s certainly made more hacks than anyone else. Many of his hacks are “meme” hacks he made in a day, such as Super Releasio 64 [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wYxMhCXyTkA]. Other hacks are quite impressive but still pretty simple. By far the most popular hack Kaze has made is Super Mario 64 Online [https://www.polygon.com/2017/9/11/16288180/super-mario-64-online-multiplayer-mod-download]. Now, SM64O isn’t actually a ROM hack in itself. Instead, it is a Windows executable program that connects to an emulator and sends data to and from it, allowing people to play SM64 with others online. The only reason I am considering it as a “hack” Kaze made is because it utilizes many techniques of ROM hacking to function. As you can imagine, this became extremely popular from the moment it was announced, with many news sites reporting on it. But quite shortly after its release, Online was taken down by Nintendo, along with many of Kaze’s Youtube videos on its development [https://www.polygon.com/nintendo/2017/9/20/16340216/super-mario-64-online-takedown-dmca-kaze-emanuar]. Kaze reacted to this by removing all Nintendo content from the project, and renaming it “Net64” so there would be nothing Nintendo could do to take it down.

Now, I don’t want to only talk about Kaze’s ROM hacks, as there are certainly many, many others out there. The most popular non-Kaze hack by far is Super Mario Star Road, a hack made by Skelux, one of the fathers of SM64 ROM hacking [http://sm64hacks.com/hack.php?id=2]. The hack features 130 new stars and is certainly a recommended hack for anyone who wants to start playing ROM hacks. Other notable titles include Super Mario 74 by Lugmillord, which was the first “full” hack ever made, with 151 stars and every level replaced [https://mario64hacks.wikia.com/wiki/Super_Mario_74]. By comparison, The Missing Stars (the first ROM hack ever) only contains 38 new stars, and its levels are extremely basic. There are also series of ROM hacks, such as the Star Revenge series by BroDute, which at the time of writing has a whopping 18 hacks [http://sm64hacks.com/hacks.php, number is possibly off slightly], all with many new levels and stars, or the Shining Stars series made by sm64pie, which only has 3 hacks but they all have some really cool levels.

The final question I had was the process by which SM64 ROM hacks are made. This process can certainly look daunting to people with no experience due to the number of required tools, but in reality it’s not too hard. The first step is to model your level. This is usually done with commercial 3D modelling software, such as SketchUp [https://www.sketchup.com] or Blender [https://www.blender.org]. Once the level is modelled and textured, it is imported with the SM64 Editor [https://origami64.net/showthread.php?tid=39], made by Skelux, the same person who created Super Mario Star Road. The editor is based off an old importer made by Frauber, the person who created SM64: The Missing Stars [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giRrTidMSmQ, read description]. Once the model is imported (which can be a very unreliable process), objects must be added. This is done with either Toad’s Tool 64 [http://qubedstudios.rustedlogic.net/ToadsTool64.htm] or Quad64 [https://github.com/DavidSM64/Quad64]. Sometimes people don’t import new levels at all, and instead use one of these programs to edit the original levels of the game. Hacking can also involve changing the game’s text or replacing textures, such as the textures for the HUD (Heads-Up Display, the statistics shown on screen which tell the player information such as how much life the player has left). Replacing these textures can give the game a very different look and feel from the original Super Mario 64.

More advanced hackers, such as the previously mentioned Kaze Emanuar, instead change the game’s code directly. They do this with assembly code, which is basically a readable version of machine code. There are many types of assembly languages, but SM64 uses MIPS Assembly [http://logos.cs.uic.edu/366/notes/mips%20quick%20tutorial.htm]. This allows people to code their own things into SM64, such as new objects. A great example is Kaze’s More Object Patches, which can be found here, here and here. The objects in these videos aren’t in the original SM64 at all, but were instead completely coded in by Kaze. However, most of the ideas for the objects come from other Super Mario games. These patches are similar to the ones I mentioned when talking about legality issues. They are simply applied to your ROM and you can use the objects in your own hack. Assembly itself is complicated to learn, but once you get the hang of it the amount of stuff you can do in your hack dramatically increases.

In conclusion, I’ve discovered that the world of SM64 ROM hacks is a very interesting place. After you understand the laws behind it and how to make sure what you’re doing isn’t illegal, a whole world of creativity opens up. You can play some of the popular hacks I’ve mentioned like Last Impact or Star Road, play SM64 with friends with Super Mario 64 Online, or even create your own hacks with the right tools. The total number of hacks in the world is ridiculous, and more are being made every week. The experience never has to end. This is the reason why I am so interested in the hacks of this classic game, and why I chose these hacks to write my research report on.
