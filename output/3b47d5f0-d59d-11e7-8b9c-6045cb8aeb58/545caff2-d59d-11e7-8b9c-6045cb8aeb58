A field is defined, necessitatively so, by it's expressions. This is true in all fields whether the field is a bound or unbound field (also known as a closed or open system). This is my first law of field mechanics that I believe I have discovered: "A field exists, necessitatively so, by virtue of it's measurable expression(s)". I have, so far, found that it is true in every tested case.

All field expressions in the system in which we exist define the field itself, as has been declared thus far. In a few schools of physics, it has many names. I will list a few:

# String theory #
Branes

# Relativity #
Space-time

#  Quantum Mechanics #
Quantum Fluid or dark energy

# Electromagnetic field theory #
Aether/Ether 

With each of these schools of thought, you have what is denotatively called a field as expressed with phenomena with spatial attributes OF the field medium. In this context, spatial means phenomenal expressions or expressions with dimensionality (i.e. location, magnitude, vectors, etc). In the case of String theory, the spatial expression are vibrating strings. In the case of Relativity it is curved space and the expressions that occur due to it's curving. In the case of Quantum mechanics, the spatial expressions are an infinite regression of fractal particles made of an infinite regression of fractal particles until you reach a state of quantum superposition. In the case of Electromagnetic field theory, the spatial expressions are field modalities, each modality with it's own attributes and characteristics that describe the expression of the same.

My version of Field Theory stems from the older school of thought that is Electromagnetic field theory. Because everything phenomenal that we can observe, is electrical in nature. But I will skip over this in favor of explaining how gravity is magnetism and save a bit of reading.

There are two dimensionalities of the field we exist in: spatial and counter-spatial. There are two, necessitatively so, due to the way field expressions occur. The spatial dimensionality is where magnetism exists as an expression of "Force and Motion". Magnetism is the force that gives spatial solidity to all field expressions that have magnetic component. Which is all base elements and field perturbations (i.e. energy transfer through a medium [i.e. waves]). Simply put, magnetism creates magnitude (i.e. mass).

Now how does magnetism cause magnitude? By an expression called field pressure mediation. Each magnet has, in it's center, a gyroscopic plane of inertia. You can view this plane under a magnetic viewing film to verify. This plane is circular in spatial geometric shape. In the center of this plane, there is no force. Think of the eye of a hurricane, center of a tornado, or a whirlpool.

Field pressure mediation is the expression of the inactive field potential becoming active. To get a clear picture of this, think of a very large and deep pool of water with a drain in it's bottom. The total magnitude of the body of water can be used to express pressure by PSI (pounds per inch) analogously. The drain can only allow so much water to flow at any given vector of time. When the drain is opened, you see a perfect jet of water with force proportional to the pressure of the total body of water. The inactive field potential is the water. The magnetic lines of force are the water being jetted out through the plane of inertia. Potential energy is converted into kinetic energy by classical standards. 

The difference in field pressure mediation that creates magnetism and that which is else where observed, is that the magnetic lines of force always return to the source. The plane of inertia. This is also due to field pressure mediation and it can be observed and tested in a pseudo-holographic construct made from a micron-thin ferrous material, in a non-ferrous liquid pressed between two thin plates of glass (for clear viewing). This is called a ferrocell and it allows one to see magnetic lines of force, not to be confused with the 2-dimensional iron filings lines often shown as demonstration in most textbooks. Under the ferrocell, the 3 dimensional geometry of the magnetic lines of force become obvious. With a 3 dimensional ferrocell construct, one can view the total dimensions of the geometry of the lines of force. They form a slightly egg-shaped toroid. The motion of these magnetic lines of force in this toroidal form is the motion of reciprocating procession. That is, the lines appear from the plane of inertia at the so-called "north" pole and proceed in a spirographic path back to the plane of inertia.

The reciprocating, processional nature of magnetic expression is the same for all magnetic geometries regardless of magnitude and flux density. That is the manner in which magnetism is caused and terminates as defined by the observed expression of field pressure mediation.

Now for how gravity is magnetism and what makes it coherent or incoherent.

In the common schools of thought, regarding physics, "spin" plays a giant role in the atomic nature of the universe. This same concept of spin, is what was explained above with the nature of magnetism and how it is caused.

In the case of gravity, we have to understand the incommensurability of a spatial magnet. Incommensurability can be thought of as analogous to fractals. When a magnet is broken, you then have two magnets, each with their own reciprocation and procession as well as their own plane of inertia. This is true for as many times that a magnet can be split into two smaller pieces. The same result occurs each time. A magnet becomes two, becomes four, becomes eight, and so on. Until you come down to the smallest magnet: The atom.

When you have a ferrous material that is not magnetized, it is merely useless material. Neodymium iron boron made into a cube might have a mass of 4oz. A curious fact arises when this 4oz cube is magnetized. It's weight never changes. But it suddenly is now able to lift other ferrous objects against the force of earth's magnetic field. The reason for this comes in the very nature of how magnets work in conjunction to other magnets.

Every atom in field theory is a field expression. A perturbation. A spatial phenomenal with magnitude (i.e. mass). Magnitude means mass. No atom ever physically touches another because of magnetism. Magnetic force lines are what prevents any atom from ever touching another and causing interference ("Interference is used here because in Electromagnetic field theory, all spatial phenomena is a field perturbation [i.e. waves of the field medium]).

Each atom is a tiny magnetic dynamo. Like a macro-sized magnet, such as our example 4oz neodymium, it has the reciprocation and procession. The push and the pull. The push is always stronger than the pull. Yet the pull always equally opposes an external pull and the same for the push when it meets another external push. This is why north to south attracts and same side repels. Polarity occurs due to dielectric potential. Dielectric, in electrodynamics, is the amount of polarization a material has. Different materials have different values of polarization. This is why we have insulators and conductors. It is the dielectric attribute of a field perturbation that terminates as magnetic radiation during field pressure mediation.

As all magnets are tiny field perturbations with magnitude (i.e. mass; i.e. magnetism), when combined with other atoms, they become a larger magnet. Atoms to molecules and molecules to the everyday things we see around us. Each atom of the base element it creates has a different sized drain so to speak (plane of inertia) which means different flux densities from other atoms. Different magnitudes, different dimensional characteristics such as weight, hardness, malleability, permittivity, permeability, conductance, etc. Each atom also has a different spatial geometry that also dictates the size of the plane of inertia as well as the toroidal diameter at each layer of magnetic lines of force (flux density based on distance from the plane of inertia).

We know that when we place multiple magnets together north to south or south to north, the magnetic fields of all the magnets become a single larger magnetic field with a single plane of inertia. The same thing occurs with atoms. The earth is a massive amalgam of atoms, each type having very different flux density diameters, magnitudes, and geometries. This clustering of all manner of different magnetic fields, constantly out of alignment is a field of magnets. Or more accurately, a field OF field expressions. This field of magnets is, geometrically, a bound system. Meaning it has boundary of geometric dimensions. In the case of the earth, is it a slightly egg-shaped sphere. This binding field is incoherent. Incoherent because all of the atomic magnets are not in alignment due to whatever expressions in the primordial past brought them to that point.

An incoherent magnetic mass has a large magnetic flux diameter, but low flux density. Meaning it has a very large, but very weak, magnetic field. This is shown quite simply by jumping up from the ground. The flux is so weak, we can physically overpower it and lift ourselves off the ground with force. However, no matter how much force we exert, we always come back down. Because we, as field expressions ourselves, are made of atomic magnets too. And we are not able to physically jump with enough force to be completely outside of the binding system (i.e. earth's magnetic diameter). So as we jump, we are fighting against force and motion with our force and motion. The larger field extends more area, and entropy ensues. We slow down to a pure stop. At the apex of complete loss of our force and motion, we begin to build inertia and accelerate. Accelerate back to the earth, pulled by it's massive incoherent flux diameter.

A coherent magnetic mass, such as our trusty example 4oz neodymium magnet, has a much more dense magnetic field. Meaning many times more lines of force than an incoherent magnetic mass of the same weight of 4oz. This flux density makes the coherent magnetic field much stronger than that of earth's incoherent magnetic field. It is the reason that a small ceramic magnet can pick up a small iron-based object off of a table or the ground itself. It's coherency, it's atomic alignment, is much more dense than earth's. Therefore it has enough magnetic force to defy "gravity" ha ha.

Non-ferrous materials are still made of atomic magnets, each with their own flux field and flux density, as previously stated. So the only difference in earth's magnetic field and a normal magnet is field coherency. Non-ferrous material are usually very incoherent and most definitely cannot overcome earth's magnetic diameter. So, they fall to earth like any other material will whether ferrous or not.

And that is as simple as I can make it. Earth's gravity is nothing more than incoherent magnetism. All large cosmic bodies have magnetic fields that are different degrees of coherency. Black holes are almost perfect coherency and so the magnetic field is so dense that the transverse magnetic component of even a light perturbation is pulled with force and motion. This is a phenomena called, "Faraday Rotation" in which Michael Faraday discovered that magnetism, on it's own, can bend light and even cause it's wavelength to refract (change light's color from blue end spectrum to red end spectrum). But that is another topic for another time.
