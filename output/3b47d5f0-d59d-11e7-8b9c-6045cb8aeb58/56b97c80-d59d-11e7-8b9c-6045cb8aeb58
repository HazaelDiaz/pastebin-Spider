Is that Naix? I think he’s got rage and two supports behind him. You know what? Fuck it. I’m throwing it downfield.

Yeah, I see Venge open on the flank. But fuck that. Support kills are for faggots. I’m fucking Mirana fucking Nightshade. I can get that arrow in there. And, even if I can’t, I bet I’ll be able to pull it off the next go round. I like going for max-stun arrows. It makes my dick hard.

What’s that? I should stun the guy the Alch's got right there? Fuck that. That’s gay. Wait for the slow? Gay. the guy the pudge ulted? Gay. working with my team to not stack stuns? Kevin Spacey gay. This is fucking Dota. You can’t just expect wins to come to you. You can’t massage that shit. You gotta grab that game by the throat and rape the ever-loving shit out of it. You think stunning the ulting Crystal Maiden is gonna win you a game? You’re a pussy. This ain’t Clinton Loomis running this offense. Mirana’s got the arm. The dragon. You gotta unleash the dragon.

Okay, I’m shooting it. Nice. Look how far it went. I look good. I bet I made that Roshan wet his panties with that shot. He fucking wants me. I bet he likes it over a stair railing. I can hit that with 100% accuracy, my dear. Mmmmmm. I am delicious.

Oh shit. Looks like I hit a lane creep. Again. Oh well. It still felt fucking great to shoot that shit. Tell me that wasn’t one of the prettiest arrows you ever saw. You know what? Not only am I gonna shoot it long the next time we hit the field. I’m gonna shoot it even longer. Harder. You see that Wyvern going for the bottom rune half a map away? I’m gonna nail her right between the fucking eyes with a Mirana fastball. Why? Because I can.

This is the Priestess of the Moon we’re talking about here. We’re talking 210 lbs. of twisted steel and sex appeal. I’m not just a gunslinger. I’m a cumslinger. Shooting that arrow long tells all the POTM fans that I am fucking out there. On the edge. Where I gotta be. Everybody love the danger. The unpredictability. Oh, maybe I’ll tease them with a pretty point-blank arrow every now and again. But then I’m gonna go right back to pumping that arrow out for all it’s worth. It tells them I shoot like I fuck. That’s how we do things in the sexy business.

Tell me you’re not turned on right now. I am.
