Bemass Muscle It is essential that you consume enough vegetables. Diets that are designed to promote muscle growth typically emphasize protein and complex carbs while placing much less importance on vegetables. Vegetables are packed with vitamins and minerals, two things that are absent from high concentrations in protein and carbohydrate-rich foods. You can also get a good amount of fiber from them. Fiber allows the body to use protein effectively.
